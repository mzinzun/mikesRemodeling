about Me:
As a youth, I was top of my class in Wood and Metal shop. I first entered the construction industry in 2002, as a Plaster Finisher, applying interior and exterior stucco. Having extended my skillset to neigboring hanging drywall, and install fixtures, I soon discovered my talent for painting. Putting it all together, I have been remodeling homes and businesses for over 10 years. My philosophy is simple: Value driven - Quality assured.
Understanding the value of service, I also provide steep discounts for those struggling financially.  Let's meet so we can see how my skills and experience can meet your remodeling needs.

form validate subject: replacing html tags in form input

In general, the way to prevent XSS(cross-site scripting) attacks is to remove HTML tags from any untrus‚Äê
ted data before using it to create dynamic document content. You can fix the
greet.html file shown earlier by replacing special HTML characters in the untrusted
input string with their equivalent HTML entities:
name = name
 .replace(/&/g, "&amp;")
 .replace(/</g, "&lt;")
 .replace(/>/g, "&gt;")
 .replace(/"/g, "&quot;")
 .replace(/'/g, "&#x27;")
 .replace(/\//g, "&#x2F;")
